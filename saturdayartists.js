He crafted songs with sincere themes about chasing love and relationships and dealing with everyday trials and failures. In 2015 he relocated to Oak Park, California and released debut album 1994 Toyota Corolla, followed in 2017 with The Rise of Hobo Johnson. In March of 2018, along with a band of friends, he released a video online for the song 'Peach Scone,'' participating in NPR's Tiny Desk submissions contest. The video quickly went viral, collecting millions of views in a few short weeks. The online interest in the project shot The Rise of Hobo Johnson into the Billboard charts.",

//     bio: `Influenced by the Southern-style swagger of UGK and the rhymes of his hometown heroes the Diplomats, A$AP Rocky gave up slinging drugs in Harlem and moved to Elmwood Park, New Jersey, where he started rapping. By the time he had completed his GED, the self-proclaimed hood outcast had already gained comparisons to Wiz Khalifa and was being championed by Fader magazine, Stereogum, and rap superstar Drake, due to the Internet-leaked singles "Peso" and "Trilla." In 2011, just after he turned 22, A$AP Rocky released the Deep Purple mixtape and followed it months later with the digital release of his debut effort, the street album Live.Love.A$AP. After signing a reportedly large deal with Sony, the album was re-released in February of 2012. Even without an official debut album, the rapper rounded out the year with a nomination for BBC Radio's Sound of 2012 poll, performing alongside Rihanna at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, playing Lana Del Rey's husband in the singer's "National Anthem" video, and landing a spot in a television commercial for the popular video game FIFA Soccer 13.
//     His official debut album, Long.Live.A$AP, finally landed in 2013 and featured the single "Goldie." Santigold, 2 Chainz, Kendrick Lamar, and Yelawolf were among his guests, while production came from the likes of Clams Casino, Danger Mouse, and Jim Jonsin. Executive produced by Danger Mouse and Juicy J, the album A.L.L.A. (At Long Last A$AP) followed in 2015, featured FKA Twigs and Lykke Li as guests, and debuted at number one. Over the next two years, A$AP Rocky was featured on a number of tracks, including Selena Gomez's "Good for You," Alicia Keys' "Blended Family (What You Do for Love)," and Lana Del Rey's "Summer Bummer." In early 2018, he collaborated with Gucci Mane, 21 Savage, and London on da Track on "Cocky," a single from the film Uncle Drew. His third solo album, Testing, arrived in May that year, debuting at #4 on the Billboard 200 and featuring guest performances from the likes of Frank Ocean, FKA Twigs, Skepta, and Kid Cudi. "Potato Salad," a collaborative single with Tyler, the Creator, and "Sundress," a solo single, followed later that year. In April 2019, A$AP Rocky and Joey Bada$$ collaborated on the track "Too Many Gods," which was featured on the compilation For the Throne: Music Inspired by the HBO Series Game of Thrones. ~ Jason Lymangrover`,

//     bio: `One of the more fascinating artistic evolutions since the late 2000s has been that of Tyler, The Creator. The rapper and producer surfaced as a founding member of Odd Future, an outlandish alternative rap crew that gradually permeated the mainstream as it begat a multitude of related projects. A high percentage of these recordings, including Earl Sweatshirt's Earl (2010), Odd Future's The OF Tape, Vol. 2 (2012), and Frank Ocean's Grammy-winning Channel Orange (2012), have been made with Tyler's deep involvement. As a solo artist, Tyler's output has gleefully swung from purposefully distasteful and crude to charming and sophisticated, sometimes blurring the distinction between the extremes. All four of his own albums, namely Goblin (2011), Wolf (2013), Cherry Bomb (2015), and Flower Boy (2017), have debuted within the Top Five of the Billboard 200, distinguished most (above all other qualities) by his gravelly voice and an irascible disposition befitting a collision-shop owner. Tyler reached a new level of acceptance with the kaleidoscopic latter LP, nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Rap Album. Since then, Tyler has continued to extend his reach outside the Odd Future universe, and has issued stray singles and an EP, Music Inspired by Illumination & Dr. Seuss' The Grinch (2018).
//
//
// Tyler Okonma was born and raised in Los Angeles County, splitting time in Ladera Heights and nearby Hawthorne. He got his first taste of fame when The Los Angeles Times ran a "teen on the street"-type story on the then-16-year-old skateboarding enthusiast, who was also interested in music and fashion. Around this time, Tyler began making music with Odd Future's other core members, and in 2009 released a solo mixtape titled Bastard. By the end of the following year, OF's surreal and filthy material, epitomized by Earl Sweatshirt's mixtape Earl -- most of which Tyler produced -- had earned them a loyal following. It was during that year that a video Tyler directed for the OF track "French" took off, topping a million views by December and drawing attention to a slew of additional crew-related mixtapes that followed.
//
//
// Signed as a solo artist to a one-album deal with XL Recordings, Tyler made his proper solo debut with Goblin. Upon its May 2011 arrival, the album became the first Odd Future-related product to be released through the traditional music-industry channels, and debuted at number five on the Billboard 200. Meanwhile, Tyler continued to produce for OF and its affiliates, most notably on The OF Tape, Vol. 2 and a later 2012 release, Frank Ocean's Channel Orange, which won a Grammy for Best Urban Contemporary Album. Tyler's second LP, Wolf, followed on the Odd Future label in April 2013. It entered the Billboard 200 at number three with an expansive list of guests -- including Erykah Badu, Pharrell, Stereolab's Laetitia Sadier, and Quadron's Coco O -- reflective of Tyler's aesthetic.
//
//
// Tyler's third proper album, Cherry Bomb, another Odd Future label offering, leaked to online streaming services before its official April 2015 release date. It nonetheless became the artist's third consecutive Top Ten entry, enhanced with uncredited guest appearances from Kanye West and Lil Wayne. Tyler's number of productions and guest appearances subsequently continued to increase through collaborations with Ocean, fellow OF associates the Internet and Domo Genesis, and A$AP Mob. Flower Boy, his acclaimed fourth solo album, was issued through Columbia in July 2017. The LP landed at number two on the Billboard 200 and was later nominated for Best Rap Album at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards. Tyler the following year released a small batch of non-album singles, as well as an EP-length release, the unsurprisingly animated Music Inspired by Illumination & Dr. Seuss' Grinch. ~ Andy Kellman`,

Her major-label debut, 2017's Ctrl, helped SZA score the most nominations of any female at the 2018 Grammy awards. In addition, she was the key component on a handful of Top Ten pop hits from the likes of Maroon 5 ("What Lovers Do") and Kendrick Lamar ("All the Stars").

//
// Born Solana Imani Rowe in St. Louis, Missouri in 1990, she was raised in New Jersey, where she excelled in high school gymnastics and cheerleading. After leaving college, Rowe shuffled around different jobs, recording on the side, until a fortuitous meeting in 2011 led to an introduction with Top Dawg Entertainment, home to Kendrick Lamar and ScHoolboy Q. The budding relationship would later bear fruit and help propel SZA into the mainstream.
//
//
// Inspired by the likes of Billie Holiday, John Coltrane, Björk, and Wu-Tang Clan (whose RZA inspired her performing name), Rowe self-released her debut EP See.SZA.Run in late 2012, quickly followed by S in early 2013. The pair of EPs formed a dreamy, alluring, and occasionally unorthodox introduction to her alternative R&B and neo-soul style. After maintaining contact over the years, Rowe eventually signed with Top Dawg and entered the studio to record her debut LP, all the while staying in the public eye with strategic features, touring, and EP releases. A fantasy-like video for the S EP's "Ice Moon" was released in November 2013, and additional exposure came shortly thereafter through "His & Her Friend," off labelmate ScHoolboy Q's Oxymoron. The digital-only Z, a trippy ten-track set with assists from Lamar, Chance the Rapper, and Isaiah Rashad, arrived in April 2014 and entered the Billboard 200 at number 39. Appearances on a string of well over a dozen tracks -- Travis Scott's "OK Alright," Rihanna's "Consideration," and Lamar's "Untitled 04 | 08.14.2014" among them -- followed in 2015 and 2016.
//
//
// Signed to major-label RCA, Rowe issued the critically acclaimed Ctrl in June 2017. Featuring collaborations with Pharrell Williams, Frank Dukes, and Top Dawg regular Tyran Donaldson (aka the Antydote and Scum), the album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and topped the R&B/hip-hop chart. Platinum-certified, Ctrl garnered five nominations at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and Best Urban Contemporary Album. She followed the album's success with "What Lovers Do," a Top Ten hit collaboration with Maroon 5, as well as a spot with Khalid and Post Malone on a remix of Lorde's "Homemade Dynamite." In early 2018, Rowe appeared with Lamar on the shimmering "All the Stars," the lead single from the chart-topping soundtrack to the film Black Panther. That year, she also joined Cardi B on the rapper's "I Do." ~ Andy Kellman & Neil Z. Yeung`,

However, prior to the press coverage, Wallows had already existed for several years. Featuring childhood friends singer/guitarist Minnette, singer/guitarist (and fellow actor) Braeden Lemasters, and drummer Cole Preston, Wallows initially grew out of a school-age music class they all took. By their teens, they were playing under various names, including appearing on the 2011 Warped Tour. Also during this period, the bandmembers balanced pursuing their musical goals with Minnette's and Lemasters' budding acting careers. Settling on the name Wallows, they signed with Atlantic and in 2018 released their debut EP, Spring, featuring the singles "Pictures of Girls" and "These Days." In early 2019 the group issued their full-length debut, Underneath the Streetlights in the Winter Outside Your House.`,

The band made their full-length debut with Little Dragon (2007), the source of the chilling ballad "Twice," beginning a streak of Top Five dance/electronic albums with Ritual Union (2011), and hit the Top 15 of the U.K. chart with Nabuma Rubberband (2014), which earned them a Grammy nomination for Best Dance/Electronic Album. Since then, they've added to their discography with releases such as Season High (2017) and the Lover Chanting EP (2018).

//     bio: `Atlanta rapper Playboi Carti debuted with a repetitive and catchy flow like contemporaries Lil Uzi Vert and Young Thug, gaining recognition in the mid-2010s as an affiliate of A$AP Mob. A steady succession of viral singles and high-profile tour support slots built a following that helped Carti's 2018 debut album, Die Lit, debut at number three on the Billboard charts.
//
//
// Born Jordan Carter in the south side of the city, Carti grew up listening to Prince, Michael Jackson, R. Kelly, Lil Jon, Gucci Mane, and Jeezy, starting his music career in high school under the name Sir Cartier. His early work was produced by Awful Records' in-house man Ethereal. Tracks like the narcotic "YUNGXANHOE" and "Lost" helped him garner a local following, were promoted on the Internet, and notched millions of streams. After graduating, he moved to the Bronx, where he became acquainted with members of A$AP Mob. In early 2015 at a show at SXSW, Carti met A$AP main man A$AP Rocky, who took Carti under his wing. A month later, Carti issued the singles "Broke Boi" and "Fetti," which became viral hits. Tours with Lil Uzi Vert and A$AP Ferg followed before Carti signed a deal with Interscope Records. Backed by A$AP Rocky, Carti appeared on A$AP Mob's Cozy Tapes tracks "Telephone Calls" and "London Town." After years of generating interest with singles, Carti released his debut mixtape, Playboi Carti, in the spring of 2017. The collection featured appearances by Lil Uzi Vert, A$AP Rocky, and singer Leven Kali. He followed that up in 2018 with the release of his studio debut, Die Lit, which featured guest appearances from Nicki Minaj, Young Thug, Skepta, Lil Uzi Vert, Travis Scott, and Chief Keef, among others. Upon release, the set peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and rose to number two on the R&B/Hip-Hop chart. ~ Neil Z. Yeung`,

//     bio: `The stylistic range of left-field pop artist Kali Uchis is reflected in the variety of her collaborators -- an extensive genre-crossing list that includes Tyler, the Creator, Gorillaz, Daniel Caesar, Juanes, and BadBadNotGood. A singer, songwriter, and producer, as well as a video director, Uchis truly arrived on her own with the self-released Por Vida (2015), an EP that led to a deal with Virgin EMI. By the time Uchis released her lively debut full-length, the Top Five Billboard R&B/hip-hop hit Isolation (2018), she had already been nominated for Grammy awards through her featured appearances on Caesar's "Get You" and Juanes' "El Ratico."
//
//
// Born Karly-Marina Loaiza, Kali Uchis experienced the majority of her upbringing in Virginia and also spent time in her parents' native Colombia. As a teenager growing up in Alexandria, just south of Washington, D.C., she learned to play piano and saxophone and also developed a deep interest in visual arts. Her recorded debut was made in 2012 with the self-released mixtape Drunken Babble. Within three years, she had several singles to her credit, including "Know What I Want" and "Lottery," typically promoted with videos she directed, as well as collaborations with Snoop Dogg, GoldLink, Tyler, the Creator, and Major Lazer. Following the 2015 independent release of Por Vida, a free digital-download EP with tracks produced by Diplo, Kaytranada, and Tyler, Uchis started releasing her material through major-label Virgin EMI. A DJ Dahi-tweaked version of Por Vida's "Ridin Round," issued that November after a move to Los Angeles, was the artist's first single for the major label. "Only Girl," a relaxed Kaytranada production featuring Vince Staples and the Internet's Steve Lacy, followed in April 2016. She was also featured that year on Daniel Caesar's "Get You."
//
//
// Throughout 2017, Uchis added to her discography of featured appearances via tracks by Juanes, Gorillaz, Tyler, Bootsy Collins, and Miguel, and she previewed her debut album with the singles "Tyrant" (featuring Jorja Smith) and "Nuestro Planeta" (featuring Reykon). By the end of the year, "Get You" had been nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best R&B Performance, and Juanes' "El Ratico" made Uchis a Latin Grammy nominee when it was up for Record of the Year. January 2018 saw the release of the BadBadNotGood-produced single "After the Storm" (featuring Tyler and Bootsy). Uchis released her debut album, Isolation, three months later. It debuted at number 32 on the Billboard 200 and entered the R&B/hip-hop chart at number four. ~ Andy Kellman`,

The two met while attending the University of Toronto. In early 2013, as Good People, they dropped their debut EP, After Hours, as a free download. Later in the year, the Drake track "Hold on, We're Going Home" appeared as a "featuring Majid Jordan" release. The track climbed into Billboard's Top Five that summer, just as it was announced that the duo signed with Drake's OVO Music. The label released their A Place Like This EP in 2014, while the singles "My Love" and "Something About You" landed a year later.

With Gene taking on the name Malice, the brothers formed Clipse in the early '90s, quickly forming a relationship with the Neptunes' Pharrell Williams and embarking on a career that would include major-label record deals and critically revered albums. In 2010, the duo announced they were taking a break to focus on solo careers. Pusha would sign with Kanye West's G.O.O.D. Music imprint and land on his new label boss' album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy that same year.
